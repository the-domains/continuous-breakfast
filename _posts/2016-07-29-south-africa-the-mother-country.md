# **South Africa, The Mother Country**

**South Africa's scenery is legendary**, pick up any travel or lifestyle magazine and you will see the lofty Table Mountain or the russet tinged vineyards staring right back at you. She proudly wears her deserved title of **"A world in one country"** and rightly so for there's so much more to South Africa than fine wine, **beaches and bush.**

**South Africa's hotels and spas** are consistently rated amongst the very finest in the world and with trendy boutique hotels, restored colonial homes, vineyard retreats, the ultimate in luxury game lodges and child friendly resorts so those of you who are in search of original, luxurious accommodation will be in seventh heaven when planning your vacation to South Africa.

Brimming with lip smacking wines and inexpensive **world class cuisine** South Africa is a foodies dream. The cuisine depicts a blend of many cultural societies with a tantalizing table that has evolved over centuries. Take it from us the traditional "Cape Dutch" cuisine is sublime, and it's for this reason that my signature**"Cooks Itinerary of South Africa"** has proven to be so popular.

**South Africa has nine provinces;- Cape Town (known as the mother city) is the heart of the Western Cape although the Cape Winelands, Cape Whale Coast (along the Overberg coast from Hermanus past Gansbaai to De Hoop Nature Reserve) and The Garden Route don't have to hustle too hard for their share of the limelight.**

**The Cape Winelands (Western Cape)** is without doubt an area of spectacular beauty with its rugged mountains, fertile valleys, scenic mountain passes, historical monuments and of course acres upon acres of lush vineyards and world-famous wine estates. It is the largest wine producing region in South Africa and is divided into**six main wine regions**, each offering their own unique wine route. **Constantia, Stellenbosch, Franschhoek, Paarl, Robertson and Wellington are the most popular.**
